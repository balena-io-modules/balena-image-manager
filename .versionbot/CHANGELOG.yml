                Node 14 may well still work with the SDK for
                quite a while, but we'll no longer actively test
                against them since they are now
                characterized as EOL, and it's quite possible
                that it may stop working entirely in any future
                release.

                        Be more lenient with decoding compressed responses,
                        since (very rarely)

                        servers send slightly invalid gzip responses that are still accepted

                        by common browsers.


                        Always using Z_SYNC_FLUSH is what cURL does.

                        this would mean the UI nginx would respond with
                        the page not found page, and that content would
                        have ended up being saved as the token.

                Node 10 may well still work with the SDK for quite a
                while, but we'll no longer actively test against them
                since they are now characterized as EOL, and it's
                quite possible that it may stop working entirely in any
                future release.

                        Be more lenient with decoding compressed responses,

                        servers send slightly invalid gzip responses that are still accepted

                        by common browsers.

                Setting a 3-digit semver to the release.semver field
                is the suggested approach, instead of setting the
                release.release_version field. This fixes the unique
                constraint issue that release_version was often
                causing to users, since in case a duplicate semver is
                provided, the backend will auto-increment the
                revision field of the release. A composite
                release.version field is also added, which has a raw
                field with the complete unique version of the release.

              hash: 08dde2331405f29c8789bb2523a8e7fc574ba373
              body: |
                Used the NoInfer helper to prevent TS from using the
                old pine.get overloads, unless the generic
                parameters are explicitely provided. This way when
                no generic arguments are provided TS will try to
                match only the fully typed variants and in case of an
                error it will output the reason from those overloads.
                Previously it would fallback to the old pine.get
                variants and try to infer a loose generic type, which
                wasn't correct and silenced some errors This is a bit
                aggressive change and as a result I decided to limit
                this change for the strict pine variant, which is opt-in,
                and hold it back from the main typings until the next
                major.

                This is still in beta as not all deployment environments of
                balena easily support hostapps. Once we have resolved that issue
                we can move to hostapps-only model for serving OS releases.

      subject: Bump balena-sdk to v12.12.0 to stop using image maker endpoints
    - author: Thodoris Greasidis
      body: |-
        Bumping to gupl v4 wasn't trivial. Moreover it feels
        that we should better invest on refactoring to TS and
        drop gulp in favor of npm scripts, just like we do in
        other modules.
